This program is to implement particle simulations using Leap Frog Solver and Sixth Order Solver, 
with collision behavior and a Kdtree to store all the triangles mesh. 
The initial simulation starts with 100 particles at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with random colors and random velocities.

To build this code: 
    cd pba
    make clean
    make
    make stuff
    make viewer

To run this code: 
    cd pba/python
    ./pba_triangleCollision_viewer.py <obj_path>

  <obj_path> is the file path to the .obj scene model, 
  the default scene is a hand-drawing 12-triangle cube with 12 triangles with the front face invisible.
  For example: 
    To show the cube:       ./pba_triangleCollision_viewer.py
    To show the bigsphere:  ./pba_triangleCollision_viewer.py ../../models/bigsphere.obj

Command line usage: 
  - Basic viewer usage
  - PbaThing usage: 
    c/C     reduce/increase collision coefficient of restitution
    s/S     reduce/increase collision coefficient of stickiness
    g/G     reduce/increase magnitude of gravity
    e       start/stop emitting more particles
    t/T     reduce/increase animation time step
    q       switch solvers between Leap Frog and Sixth Order
    w       switch wireframe/normal display mode
    k       turn on/off KdTree
    Esc     quit
