#
# The swig directory is where the python bindings are built for pba. 
#
# The file pba.i is the swig interface file that describes the module.
# Other .i interface files may be added.
# 
# The module pba.py is created by swig, and the shared object _pba.so is built
#
# The file pba_viewer.i is the interface file for the pba_viewer module.  There should 
# not be a need to alter the viewer or the module.  The module is compiled and
# assembled separately from the pba module.
