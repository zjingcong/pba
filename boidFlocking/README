This program is to implement boid system simulations using Leap Frog Solver and Sixth Order Solver, with basic boids behaviors and simple guiding/steering.
Boids could have collisions with triangles, which could be stored and searched in Kdtree when turning on Kdtree.
The initial simulation starts with 100 particles with random positions, random velocities and random colors.

To build this code: 
    cd pba
    make clean
    make
    make stuff
    make viewer

To run this code: 
    cd pba/python
    ./pba_boid_viewer.py <obj_path>

  <obj_path> is the file path to the .obj scene model.
  Default scene is a hand-drawing 12-triangle cube with front face invisible.
  For example: 
    To show the cube:       ./pba_boid_viewer.py
    To show the bigsphere:  ./pba_boid_viewer.py ../../models/bigsphere.obj

Command line usage: 
  - Basic viewer usage

  - PbaThing usage:

        e       add boid particles
        l       switch wireframe/hide/normal display mode
        t       turn on/off KdTree
        Esc     quit
